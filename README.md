# Covid-19_PowerBI_Dashboard
This project presents an interactive COVID-19 analytics dashboard created using Microsoft Power BI. The dashboard visualizes the spread, recovery, and impact of COVID-19 using officially available case data from Indian states. It includes trend analysis, KPI measurement, geographical mapping, and comparison across different time periods.

## 🚀 Project Objectives

1. To analyze COVID-19 case trends for different states in India.

2. To visualize confirmed, recovered, and deceased cases interactively.

3. To create a time-series model showing daily/weekly/monthly patterns.

4. To build a clean and user-friendly Power BI dashboard.

5. To derive meaningful insights for understanding pandemic behaviour.

## 📂 Dataset Description

The project uses the following files:

1. raw_data_Indian_states.csv

2. vaccination_data.csv

3. case_time_series.csv 

## 📊 Power BI Visualizations Used

Line Chart: Daily trends of Confirmed, Recovered, and Deceased cases.

Map Visual: Shows state-wise distribution of COVID-19 cases.

Clustered Column Chart: Comparison of cases across states.

Cards (KPIs):

Total Confirmed

Total Recovered

Total Deceased

Recovery Rate

Mortality Rate

Slicers:

Date range filter

State filter

Monthly/Weekly period filter

## 🔍 Key Insights

Confirmed cases show a sharp rise during peak months.

Recovery rate increases over time due to improved healthcare response.

Some states exhibit consistent high caseloads due to higher population density.

Vaccination progress correlates with a reduction in daily confirmed cases.

## 🏁 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Power BI can be used to effectively analyze time-series health data, create meaningful KPIs, and derive insights through interactive data visualizations.
